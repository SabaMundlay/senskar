### Sign Language Recognition Using Image Based Hand Gesture Recognition Techniques by Ashish S. Nikam + Aarti G. Ambekar 
- automatically recognise sign language (pattern & gesture recognition) 
- real time system for recognition of hand gesture on basis of detection of some shape based features (orientation, centre of mass centroid, finger status, thumb in position) 
- image based and sensor based (image based is simpler for the end-user as there is no need to wear any tech)
- sensor based is like: helmets, gloves etc - but this is high tech and has the disadvantage of wear and tear 
- sign detection - extracting feature of certain object
- sign recognition - recognise certain shape that differentiates object from remaining shape 
- webcam for capturing images, visual studio IDE and openCV library 
- pre-processing includes removing background noise, slope distance based algorithms for finger tip detection (convexity hull algorithm) 
- gesture recognition by: hidden markov model, artificial neural network 


ideas:
* make a prototype hand (3D?) but it needs joints - using the “straight” laser-cut wood
* an app on the listener’s phone 


to do: 
* GitHub code
* openCV
* video explaining the product
* mock-up application 
* document all the research (GitHub repo)
