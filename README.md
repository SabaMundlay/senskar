# senskar

Senskar is an app for communication through text and draw. Inspired by the iOS notepad app, we wanted to integrate text to speech technology with predictive draw. This repo only contains a protype web app implemented with Flask. The android prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/vishal-android-freak/AutoDraw)

to run the prototype locally, all you need is Flask. Once you've navigated to the directory the app is stored in, you can use a [number of commands](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to run the app.
