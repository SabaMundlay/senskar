# senskar

Senskar is an app for communication through text and draw. Inspired by the iOS notepad app, we wanted to integrate text to speech technology with predictive draw. This repo only contains a protype web app implemented with Flask. The android prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/vishal-android-freak/AutoDraw)
